# android-ncw-demo
In order to compile the demo project for the first time please do the following:
* Use production flavor. The dev flavor is used internally for our development team.
* Connect this project to your existing/new Firebase project in order to sign in with google and apple in the LoginScreen. 
  You should configure the authentications in Firebase to support both providers.
