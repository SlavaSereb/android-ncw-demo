The Fireblocks Non-Custodial Wallet (NCW) solution allows you to securely and effectively manage digital assets by granting end users full control over their funds or tokens without reliance on a third-party custodian. /
The Fireblocks NCW comes with native web and mobile Software Development Kits (SDKs), which businesses can seamlessly integrate into their existing applications. This integration provides a safeguarded and smooth method for storing and overseeing digital assets. /

This repository contains the NCW Android demo application that can be used for reference during development.
